The code here implements AIs for playing Halite.  See Halite's GitHub repository (https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite) for more details about the rules of Halite.

Each file is independent, and implements its own AI.  (Therefore, this repository contains a variety of different AIs.)  Each file can be individually compiled (instructions for compiling are in a comment at the top of each file), and the compiled executable conforms to the specifications noted in https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite/blob/master/website/advanced_writing_sp.php.
